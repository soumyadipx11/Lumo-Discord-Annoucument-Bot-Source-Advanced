# Overview 🌟

- **Red is a fully modular bot**, allowing you to toggle features and commands on/off according to your preferences, ensuring complete customization. It's a self-hosted bot, necessitating you to host and maintain your instance. Red can serve as an admin bot, music bot, trivia bot, your new best friend, or any combination thereof.

## Getting Started 🚀

1. Install Yarn if not already done: `npm i -g yarn` or `sudo npm i -g yarn` (for Unix systems).
2. Fork/Clone the repository.
3. Install dependencies by typing `yarn`.
4. Duplicate `.env.example` as a new file named `.env`.
5. Execute `yarn build` to construct the Prisma schema.
6. Create a volume for the Postgres database using `docker volume create --name=postgres`.
7. Initiate the database with `docker-compose up --build postgres`, which exclusively launches the Postgres container.
8. Update the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in `/apps/bot` with `postgresql://postgres:internalpassword@localhost:5432/bot?schema=public`.
9. Before testing, ensure to push the schema to the database using `yarn pushdb` (this must be rerun every time changes are made to `prisma/schema.prisma`).
10. Test by executing `yarn dev`. Each time you save a file, the running instance will automatically halt, rebuild, and restart.

## Installation Made Easy 🛠️

Installation is straightforward, and you do not require any coding knowledge! Beyond installation and updates, every aspect of the bot can be managed directly within Discord.
